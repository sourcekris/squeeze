Edit the options in Makefile and type make. squeeze and unsqueeze
will be the executable programs; the nroff'ed man files will go into
squeeze.1, unsqueeze.1, etc. squeeze and unsqueeze are filters only; 
sqz, sqzdir, unsqz, unsqzdir, and mwcat apply them to files.
Note that the shell scripts need filterfile version 1.2 or later.

I don't pretend to know your machine's setup so there's no make install.

Read CHANGES for a list of changes. Type squeeze -C and squeeze -W
for copyright and warranty information, squeeze -H for help; similarly
for unsqueeze.
